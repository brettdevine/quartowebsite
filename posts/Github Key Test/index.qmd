So here is a test document to see how it plays out. I hope that this process can be more streamlined. Not sure how this plays out on a Windows computer.

```{r}
#| message: false
library(tidyverse)
library(ggthemes)
data("ChickWeight")
glimpse(ChickWeight)
```

```{r}
ChickWeight %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Time, y=weight, color = Diet)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_classic()
```
